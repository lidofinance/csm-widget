title: Why didn’t I get rewards?
---

There are two main reasons of you getting no reward within a frame:

1. If your validator’s performance was below the threshold within the CSM Performance Oracle frame (28 days for mainnet) the validator does not receive rewards for the given frame. Read more about [the CSM Performance Oracle](https://operatorportal.lido.fi/modules/community-staking-module#block-c6dc8d00f13243fcb17de3fa07ecc52c).
2. [Your Node Operator has stuck keys](https://operatorportal.lido.fi/modules/community-staking-module#block-0ed61a4c0a5a439bbb4be20e814b4e38) due to not exiting a validator requested for exit timely.
