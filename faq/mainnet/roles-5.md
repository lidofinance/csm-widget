title: What happens to rewards after changing the Rewards Address?
---

Rewards claimed to the previous Rewards Address remain there. After changing the Rewards Address, all rewards and excess bond accumulated on the bond balance can be claimed to the new Rewards Address. In the event of validator withdrawal, upon claiming of the bond, it would also be returned to the new Rewards Address.
