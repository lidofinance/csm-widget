title: What are the risks of running a validator?
---

Node operators face several risks, including:

1. **Technical Risk**: Maintaining reliable and secure hardware and software setups is essential. Any technical failure or vulnerability in the validator setup could lead to penalties.
2. **Penalties for Misbehavior**: Validators can be penalized for various reasons, such as going offline or attempting to manipulate the network.
3. **Market Risk**: The value of ETH can fluctuate significantly, impacting the value of the validators' staked ETH.
4. **Network Risk**: Validators are part of a decentralized network, and the security and stability of the Ethereum network as a whole can affect individual validators. Events such as network attacks or protocol upgrades may impact validator operations, leading to potential disruptions or losses.
5. **Operational Risk**: Validators require ongoing maintenance and monitoring to ensure smooth operation. Any operational issues, such as hardware failures or connectivity issues, could disrupt validator performance and result in rewards losses.
6. **Slashing Risk**: Validators can be slashed, meaning they lose a portion of their staked ETH, for violating network rules or behaving maliciously. Slashing can occur due to actions such as double signing or failing to validate correctly, resulting in significant penalties.
