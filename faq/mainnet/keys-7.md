title: Why pay for key deletion?
---

Key deletion incurs a removal fee of 0.02 ETH, which is deducted from the Node Operator's bond per each deleted key to cover the maximal possible operational costs associated with the queue processing. This fee is intended to protect the module from potential DoS attacks by malicious actors who could clog the queue with empty slots by adding and removing keys, and covers the maximal possible operational costs associated with the queue processing. The fee discourages misuse, keeping the system clear of invalid keys or keys that donâ€™t end up being deposited to.
