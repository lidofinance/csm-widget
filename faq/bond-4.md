Claiming bond and rewards in a form of ETH constitutes an stETH withdrawal process (unstake).

The withdrawal process consists of several steps you need to do:

- **Submit a withdrawal request** by choosing ETH as a token for bond/rewards claim. As a result of this step, you will receive a withdrawal NFT.
- **Claim your ETH**## What rewards do I get in CSM?

When CSM operators use the Lido protocol to run validators, they can receive two types of rewards:

- **Node Operator rewards**: a share of rewards from staker locked stake amount, currently calculated pro-rata based on validators operated as a share of total protocol validators, with [possible reductions for bad performance](https://operatorportal.lido.fi/modules/community-staking-module#block-c6dc8d00f13243fcb17de3fa07ecc52c).
- **Bond rebase**: staking rewards pertaining to the bonded tokens ((w)stETH). after request fulfilment. The fulfilment process takes 1-5 days (or longer), [depending on a variety of factors](https://help.lido.fi/en/articles/7858315-how-long-does-an-ethereum-withdrawal-take). To know if your ETH is ready to be claimed you, can check its status on the [Claim page](https://stake.lido.fi/withdrawals/claim). If your request is marked as “**Ready to claim**”, it is time for you to get your ETH back.
