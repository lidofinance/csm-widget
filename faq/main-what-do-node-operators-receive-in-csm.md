title: 'What do node operators receive in CSM?'
---

Node operators benefit from:

- **Daily Rebasing**: Start earning rewards from day one, even before validator activation. This ensures a steady flow of rewards and incentivizes participation.
- **Socialized Rewards**: Rewards are smoothed across the largest validator set, mitigating volatility. This means that even in the event of small outages or disruptions, node operators can still receive rewards, reducing the risk of rewards loss.
