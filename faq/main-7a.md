The initial bond requirement for the first validator for the mainnet is 2.4 stETH. However, for [Early Adopters](https://operatorportal.lido.fi/modules/community-staking-module#block-ef60a1fa96ae4c7995dd7794de2a3e22), this amount is reduced to 1.5 stETH to incentivize early participation.

The amount for the second and subsequent validators is 1.3 stETH
