title: 'How much bond is needed?'
---

The initial bond requirement for the first validator is 2 stETH. However, for Early Adopters, this amount is reduced to 1.5 stETH to incentivize early participation.

Subsequent bond amounts depend on the total number of validators operated by the node operator and follow a specific function known as the "bond curve," which adjusts the bond requirement based on the operator's validator count.
