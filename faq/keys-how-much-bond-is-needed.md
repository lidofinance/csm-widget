title: 'How much bond is needed?'

The initial bond requirement for the first validator is 2 stETH, reduced to 1.5 stETH for Early Adopters. Subsequent bond amounts are determined by a specific function known as the "bond curve," which adjusts the bond requirement based on the total number of validators operated by the node operator.
