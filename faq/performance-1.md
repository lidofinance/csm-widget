title: What is the Lido threshold?
---

The Lido threshold is the value that determines whether a validator should receive rewards or not. It is calculated with the average of all the efficiencies (attestation rates) of all validators.

Validators with an efficiency higher than the threshold will get rewards, while those below it wonâ€™t.
