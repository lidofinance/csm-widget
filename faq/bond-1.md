title: What rewards do I get in CSM?
---

When CSM operators use the Lido protocol to run validators, they can receive two types of rewards:

- **Node Operator rewards**: a share of rewards from staker locked stake amount, currently calculated pro-rata based on validators operated as a share of total protocol validators, with [possible reductions for bad performance](https://operatorportal.lido.fi/modules/community-staking-module#block-c6dc8d00f13243fcb17de3fa07ecc52c).
- **Bond rebase**: staking rewards pertaining to the bonded tokens ((w)stETH).
