title: Difference between bond types (ETH, stETH, wstETH)?
---

Bonds are stored in the form of stETH to so that participation as a Node Operator is more capital efficient than if the bond were un-staked (or could only be staked if sufficient deposits to fill the submitted validators were present). While node operators can submit bond in ETH, stETH, or wstETH, any submission other than stETH requires an additional transaction to convert to stETH for consistency in bond format.
