title: How much bond is needed?
---

The initial bond requirement for the first validator for the testnet is 2 stETH. However, for [Early Adopters](https://operatorportal.lido.fi/modules/community-staking-module#block-ef60a1fa96ae4c7995dd7794de2a3e22), this amount is reduced to 1.5 stETH to incentivize early participation.

Subsequent bond amounts depend on the total number of validators operated by the node operator and follow a specific function known as the “[bond curve](https://operatorportal.lido.fi/modules/community-staking-module#block-2d1c307d95fc4f8ab7c32b7584f795cf)”, which adjusts the bond requirement based on the operator's validator count.

For the testnet, the values for the bond curve are the following:
