title: How much bond is needed?

The initial bond requirement for the first validator for the testnet is 2 stETH.

Subsequent bond amounts depend on the total number of validators operated by the node operator and follow a specific function known as the “[bond curve](https://operatorportal.lido.fi/modules/community-staking-module#block-2d1c307d95fc4f8ab7c32b7584f795cf)”, which adjusts the bond requirement based on the operator's validator count.

For the testnet, the values for the bond curve are the following:
