title: What do node operators receive in CSM?
---

Node operators benefit from:

- **Daily Bond Rebase**: The collateral for CSM NOs is eligible for [rewards through stETH's rebase](https://help.lido.fi/en/articles/5230610-what-is-steth), even before validator activation.
- **Socialized Rewards**: Rewards are smoothed across the largest validator set, mitigating volatility. This means that even in the event of small outages or disruptions, node operators can still receive rewards, reducing the risk of rewards loss.
