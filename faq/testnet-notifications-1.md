Notifications are essential for staying informed about critical events within the Lido CSM protocol. By receiving alerts about exit requests, deposits, penalties, slashing incidents, and smart contract events, you can proactively manage your staking operations and address issues promptly.

Staying informed helps reduce risks while maintaining transparency and control over your activities, ensuring smooth and efficient participation in the protocol.
