title: How often do I get rewards?
---

**Node Operator rewards** on testnet are calculated and made claimable by the CSM Oracle **every 7 days**. Rewards do not have to be claimed during every reporting frame, and can be left to accumulate to be claimed later.

**Bond rebase part** of the rewards come from stETH being a rebasing token and the bond being stored in stETH. After each Accounting Oracle report that happens on testnet **every 12 epochs (1hr 20min)**, the share rate changes. Hence, the same amount of stETH shares will now be equal to a bigger stETH token balance.
