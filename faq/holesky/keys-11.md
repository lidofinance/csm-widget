A referrer is a software provider specializing in node/validator setup that integrated CSM into their tools. When a referrer directs solo stakers to join CSM via its tool, these Node Operators are marked as being referred from this provider. It doesnâ€™t affect the Node Operators rewards in any way and is used just for the funnel-tracking purposes.
