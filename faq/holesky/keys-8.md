title: Can't see the key for deletion?
---

Only keys that have not been deposited yet can be deleted. If a key has already been deposited, the only way to retrieve the bond is [to exit the validator on the Consensus Layer (CL)](https://dvt-homestaker.stakesaurus.com/bonded-validators-setup/lido-csm/exiting-csm-validators). Once withdrawn, the node operator can claim the excess bond.
