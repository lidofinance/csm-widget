title: Why run an Ethereum validator?
---

Running an Ethereum validator allows one to:

1. **Receive Staking Rewards**: Validators get network rewards for performing their duties on the Ethereum blockchain (note: incorrectly or not performing duties incurs penalties).
2. **Support the Network**: By running a validator, you actively contribute to the decentralization and security of the Ethereum network. Validators play a crucial role in reaching consensus and validating transactions, which enhances the network's reliability and resilience.
3. **Learn and Engage with the community**: Operating a validator node provides valuable insights into blockchain technology and consensus mechanisms. Through hands-on experience, individuals can deepen their understanding of Ethereum's inner workings. Moreover, it provides an opportunity to engage with the Ethereum community, share knowledge, and contribute to the network's development.
