title: How to unlock the bond?
---

To unlock the bond, the penalty amount, which includes the stolen amount and a fixed stealing fine, must be compensated on the "Locked bond" tab. This action can be performed from the Manager Address of the Node Operator.

If there are disputes regarding the penalty, node operators can start a public discussion about the penalty applied on the Lido research forum under the [CSM Support](https://research.lido.fi/c/csm-support/21) category.
