title: What makes CSM unique?
---

CSM provides several unique features to attract and benefit community stakers:

- **Rewards Smoothing**: Rewards, including Execution Layer (EL) rewards and MEV, are smoothed with other modules to provide more stable rewards comparable to operating validators solo.
- **Low Bond Requirement**: A low bond for node operators makes participation more accessible to a broader range of prospective operators.
- **Exclusive Use of ETH (stETH)**: CSM exclusively uses ETH ((w)stETH) for bond and rewards, eliminating the need for other assets and simplifying the process for node operators. The bond can be submitted as ETH, wstETH, or stETH, and both bond and rewards can be withdrawn in any of the three forms (withdrawals in the form of ETH follow the [normal Lido on Ethereum unstaking process](https://help.lido.fi/en/articles/7858323-how-do-i-unstake-my-steth)).
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Accessible through a multitude of options -- from a web UI to integrations with Dappnode, Stereum, Eth-Docker, Sedge, Stereum, CoinPillar, etc., CSM offers a leading user-friendly experience, with reduced gas fees for on-chain operations and simplified transactions for joining and claiming rewards.
- **Higher Reward Potential**: Node operators are potentially able to earn more rewards compared to vanilla solo staking, making CSM an attractive option for operators looking to run more validators to earn rewards.
