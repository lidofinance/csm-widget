title: 'What makes CSM unique?'
---

CSM provides several unique features to attract and benefit community stakers:

- **Rewards Smoothing**: Rewards, including Execution Layer (EL) rewards and MEV, are smoothed with other modules to provide more stable rewards comparable to average MEV returns.
- **Low Bond Requirement**: CSM targets a reasonably low bond for node operators, making it accessible to a broader range of prospective operators.
- **Exclusive Use of ETH (stETH)**: CSM exclusively uses ETH (stETH) for bond and rewards, eliminating the need for other assets and simplifying the process for node operators.
- **Enhanced User Experience**: CSM offers a more user-friendly experience, with reduced gas fees for on-chain operations and simplified transactions for joining and claiming rewards.
- **Higher Reward Potential**: Node operators are expected to earn more rewards compared to vanilla solo staking, making CSM an attractive option for maximizing rewards.
