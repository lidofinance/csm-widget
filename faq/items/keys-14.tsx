        A referrer is a software provider specializing in node/validator setup
        that integrated CSM into their tools. When a referrer directs solo
        stakers to join CSM via its tool, these Node Operators are marked as
        being referred from this provider. It doesn&apos;t affect the Node
        Operators rewards in any way and is used just for the funnel-tracking
        purposes.
