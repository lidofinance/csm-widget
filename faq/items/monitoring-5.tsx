        Since a strike is an indicator of the validator performing below the
        performance threshold in the given frame, Node Operators should improve
        their validator&apos;s performance to avoid getting additional strikes.
        If the validator gets more than <code>strikesThreshold</code> strikes
        assigned, it will be ejected using{' '}

        <code>min(actual TW fee paid, maxWithdrawalRequestFee)</code> will be
        confiscated from the Node Operator&apos;s bond upon validator withdrawal
        reporting.{' '}

      <p>
        If Node Operators are unable to maintain validator&apos;s performance
        above the performance threshold they should voluntary exit their
        validators immediately to avoid damaging overall protocol&apos;s
        performance and application of the corresponding penalties.
